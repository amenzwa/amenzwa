I am Amen Zwa, an ordinary bloke. I was born and raised in Burma. I now live in Washington, DC, with my wife and son. I enjoy playing jazz with my son. I work as a technology consultant, focusing on business development, technology law, and algorithm design. My degrees are in law, computer science, and electrical engineering. In my spare time, I write about law, technology, music, and motorsport. Please feel free to contact me <a rel="me" href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@AmenZwa">@AmenZwa</a> on MathsTodon.
